# LearningDynamics
Toolbox for Inferring Interaction Laws from Observing Various Self-Organized Dynamics
1. Examples are used for the paper, Learning Interaction Kernels for Agent Systems on Riemannian Manifolds, link:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00327.
2. Every main example contains solver_info (used for the numerical integrator), sys_info (contains information regarding the 
whole system), obs_info (information on how to observe the dynamical system), learn_info (information on how to infer the 
interactions from the observation), and plot_info (information on how to visualize the learning results).
3. It can also run the main examples in the PNAS and Physica D papers.
