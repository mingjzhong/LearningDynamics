Toolbox for Inferring Interaction Laws from Observing Various Self-Organized Dynamics
1. Examples are used for the paper, Nonparametric inference of interaction laws in systems of agents from trajectory data, link:
https://www.pnas.org/content/116/29/14424, PNSA, 116 (29), 14424 - 14433, July 2019.
2. Every main example contains solver_info (used for the numerical integrator), sys_info (contains information regarding the 
whole system), obs_info (information on how to observe the dynamical system), learn_info (information on how to infer the 
interactions from the observation), and plot_info (information on how to visualize the learning results).
3. For the Predator-Preys Models (PredatorPrey1stOrder, PredatorPrey1stOrderSplines, PredatorPrey2ndOrder), the error of 
phi(0) = Inf might occur occasionally, it simply means that the predator catches up on to one of the preys, and thus
causes the dynamics to stop.  Simplfy retart the learning procedure will get rid of it.
